Here is where the evilpleasure action command begins:

It is organized into conditions which are named Condition[1], Condition[2]. Condition[3], and so on and so forth. 

Condition[1] = User evilpleasurecount(Undefined): True && User Mention: True
Condition[2] = User evilpleasurecount(Undefined): True && User Non-Mention Reply: True
Condition[3] = User evilpleasurecount(Undefined): True && User Mention: False
...............................................................................
Condition[4] = User evilpleasurecount(Defined):   True && User Mention: True
Condition[5] = User evilpleasurecount(Defined):   True && User Non-Mention Reply: True
Condition[6] = User evilpleasurecount(Defined):   True && User Mention: False

Furthermore, the image links are now conveniently stored in the following server variables. That way you only have to add the links one time and then you're all set! (as opposed to 6 different times, yikes!) You'll see those variables just below this message!
